A simple image picker for Facebook written in Swift. Looks and works very similar to the native UIImagePickerController, except it uses a completion block instead of a delegate protocol.

## Requirements

* Xcode 8
* iOS 8.0+ target deployment
* FBSDKCoreKit, FBSDKLoginKit (>= 4.0)
* Swift 3 project 

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "MBFacebookImagePicker"
```

### Manually
Download the project or clone the repo. Import the `MBImagePicker` folder into your project. Make sure you have the `FBSDKCoreKit`, `FBSDKCoreKit`, and `Bolts` frameworks imported. 

## Running the example project

### With CocoaPods

Enter the following line in your terminal:

```ruby
pod try MBFacebookImagePicker
```

If you instead chose to download or clone the project directly, you must first run `pod install` from the Example directory to install all dependencies. 

Also make sure to replace `FacebookAppID` under `URL types` and `FacebookAppID` in `info.plist`.

## Usage

Make sure that your application has been setup with the [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started).

Import the library: 

```swift
import MBFacebookImagePicker
```

Show the picker:

```swift
let imagePicker = MBFacebookImagePickerController()
imagePicker.finishedCompletion = { [weak self] (result) in
    self?.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    switch result {
        case .completed(let image): self?.imageView.image = image
        case .failed(let error): print("failed with error: \(error)")
        case .cancelled: print("Cancelled!")
    }
}
present(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Note that the app needs to have been authenticated with Facebook and given permission to access `user_photos` before showing the image picker.


## Translations
